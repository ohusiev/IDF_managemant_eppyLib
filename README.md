# IDF_managemant_eppyLib
management of *.idf files from Design Builder 

## Disclaimer:
This is very basic test of eppy library based on the documantation of EPPY LIBRARY: https://eppy.readthedocs.io/en/master/

The management of *.idf files made in self-education purpose for exploring of functionality. 

The .idf files derived from the Design Builder (DB) software to learn how the functionality of library can be easily realised to avoid manual work and implement iterative change
of parameters within sertain components of DB model for further simulation in EnergyPlus engine.
